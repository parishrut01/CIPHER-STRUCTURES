## `Let's Begin`

> This module lays the foundation by answering the most essential questions: What is cryptography? Why do we need it? And how does it impact the digital world around us?
We begin with a conceptual overview of cryptography — not just as a tool for secrecy, but as a mathematical framework for ensuring confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and trust. From securing your messages to powering digital currencies, cryptography is at the heart of modern information systems.
You’ll explore its core goals, its evolution alongside technology, and the problems it was designed to solve. No prior mathematical or technical background is assumed — this section is meant to provide intuitive insights before diving deeper.
Whether you're a curious beginner or brushing up before tackling more complex ideas, this module sets the stage for everything that follows.

## `History`

> For the module on [history](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/history-of-cryptography/), we begin with classical ciphers like the [Caesar cipher](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethical-hacking/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/), [Vigenère cipher](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/vigenere-cipher/), and the ingenuity of ancient cryptographers who relied on secrecy through obscurity.
> 
>Then we move into the era of mechanical cryptography, featuring systems like the [Enigma machine](https://brilliant.org/wiki/enigma-machine/), whose cracking shaped the outcome of World War II. Next comes the revolutionary shift to modern cryptography: the invention of [public-key cryptography](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/public-key-encryption/), [RSA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/), [Diffie-Hellman](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/diffie-hellman-key-exchange-and-perfect-forward-secrecy/), and the emergence of [digital signatures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/digital-signatures-certificates/) and [hash functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/hash-functions-and-list-types-of-hash-functions/). Finally, we touch on the rise of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/zero-knowledge-proof/), [blockchain](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethical-hacking/blockchain-technology-introduction/), and cryptography’s role in decentralized systems.
>
> This historical lens doesn’t just show what came before — it reveals how each leap in cryptography responded to real-world needs and laid the groundwork for the tools we study today.

## `The Math`

> Before we can unlock the mechanics of cryptographic systems, we need to speak the language they’re built in: Mathematics.
>
> This module starts with the essentials:—
> 1. Foundation
 >> a. [Set Theory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/set-theory/).
 >> b. [Functions and Relations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/relations-and-functions/).
 >> c. [Logic](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/introduction-to-mathematical-logic/) and [Propositional Calculus](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/engineering-mathematics/proposition-logic/)
 >> iv Basic [combinatorics](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/engineering-mathematics/combinatorics/) and [Proof techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/mathematics-introduction-to-proofs/)
> 2.

## `Crypto-Math`

> The algebra beneath cryptography.  
Key topics:
- Finite fields & prime moduli
- Elliptic curves & curve arithmetic
- Polynomial commitments
- Cryptographic hash functions

Hands-on intuition meets formal definitions, leading into ZK-friendly math (e.g., SNARK circuits).

---

## `Proofs`

> The "why" and "how" of proving without revealing.  
This module introduces:
- Proof systems (interactive vs non-interactive)
- Soundness, completeness, zero-knowledge
- Example proof constructions (e.g. Schnorr, Sigma protocols)
- Circuits and constraint systems

Mathematics meets protocol design.

---

## `Extras`

> A curated selection of learning materials:
- 📚 Papers worth reading
- 📺 Lectures and talks
- 🛠️ Libraries, tools, and playgrounds (e.g., Circom, Noir, Arkworks)
